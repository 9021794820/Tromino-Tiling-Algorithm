# Tromino-Tiling-Algorithm

This is the implementation of tromino tiling algorithm. 
The program takes an input positive integer k and the position of the hole as the Linux command line and generate 
a 2k * 2k board.  
For example if your input is 4 then program generates a 16 x16 board. 

The output is represented as the below image:

Here “digit” represents the regular tile cell and “X” represents a hole.
The algorithm uses the Divide and Conquer technique and time complexity is O(n^2).
